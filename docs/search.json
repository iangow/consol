    "text": "1 Preface\nThe purpose of these notes is to provide students of ACCT 90012 Corporate Reporting with a replacement for problematic materials in the course text book, Financial Reporting (fourth edition).\nThe following portions of Financial Reporting can be read profitably in conjunction with these materials:1\nHowever, the following portions of Financial Reporting use approaches inconsistent with these materials and should be avoided or only read by students alert to the inconsistencies.\nThe reason for replacing these materials is that they provide a confusing approach to the business combination valuation reserve (BCVR). The approach to BCVR in Financial Reporting has two problems.\nFirst, treatment of BCVR is not consistent across chapters. For example, BCVR includes goodwill in Chapter 28, but excludes goodwill in Chapter 30 when the partial goodwill method is applied. In the latter case, goodwill is included in the pre-acquisition entry. In contrast, these materials always include goodwill in the pre-acquisition entry.\nSecond, the amount of BCVR varies from one period to the next. In Financial Reporting, so revaluation adjustments are moved to the pre-acquisition entry as the associated assets are consumed, even though the total amount of revaluation is unaffected. As a result, the pre-acquisition entry in Financial Reporting needs to change in each period as revaluations are shifted to that entry. In contrast, in these materials the amount of revaluation reflected in BCVR does not change (putting aside measurement period adjustments) after the acquisition date. Similarly, the pre-acquisition elimination entry also remains the same in each period.\nInterested students seeking a more comprehensive set of materials used here should note that some textbooks provide a presentation of consolidation accounting consistent with that used in these materials. For example, Accounting for Corporate Combinations and Associations (eighth edition) by Neal Arthur, Louise Luff, Peter Keet, Matthew Egan, Bryan Howieson, and Ronita Ram treats BCVR much as we do in these materials.2",

However, the acquirer might obtain control on another date that is either earlier or later than the closing date. For example, if a written agreement provides that the acquirer obtains control of the acquiree on a date before the closing date.\nOne reason that identification of the acquisition date is important is that it is the measurement date for items such as - the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired - the fair value of purchase consideration - the non-controlling interesting in the acquiree",

However, the application of the recognition principle may result in recognising some assets and liabilities that the acquiree had not previously recognised as assets and liabilities in its financial statements. For example, the acquirer recognises the acquired identifiable intangible assets, such as a brand name, a patent or a customer relationship, which the acquiree did not recognise as assets because it developed them internally and charged the related costs to expense.\nParagraph 18 of AASB 3 (IFRS 3) says: “The acquirer shall measure the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values.” The principles of fair value measurement are spelt out in AASB 13 (IFRS 13) Fair Value Measurement.\nMany acquisitions will lead to the recognition of assets and liabilities that were not recognized in the books of the acquiree. For example, internally generated intangible assets such as brands are not recognized under AASB 138 (IAS 38), but are recognized at acquisition date fair value under AASB 3 (IFRS 3).\nSimilarly under AASB 3 (IFRS 3), an acquirer shall recognise a contingent liability—as defined in AASB 137 (IAS 3) Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets—assumed in a business combination at the acquisition date even if it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.",

    "text": "2.4 Step 4: Measuring and recognizing goodwill (or a gain from bargain purchase)\nParagraph 32 says:\nThe acquirer shall recognise goodwill as of the acquisition date measured as the excess of (A) over (B) below:\nA. the aggregate of:\n\nthe consideration transferred generally measured at acquisition-date fair value\nthe amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree measured in accordance with this IFRS 3, and\nin a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree.\n\nB. the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed (FVINA)\nIf (B) exceeds (A), then the difference gives rise to a gain on bargain purchase that is recognized in profit or loss on the acquisition date and attributed to the acquirer. Paragraph 36 of AASB 3 (IFRS 3) requires that, “before recognising a gain on a bargain purchase, the acquirer shall reassess whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and shall recognise any additional assets or liabilities that are identified in that review.” The implication is that gains on bargain purchase should be very rare.\nIn many acquisitions, goodwill is the largest asset acquired.\n\n2.4.1 Measurement period\nThe measurement period is the period after the acquisition date during which the acquirer may adjust provisional amounts recognised for a business combination.\nDuring the measurement period, provisional amounts recognised shall be retrospectively adjusted to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected their measurement as of the acquisition date. The acquirer shall also recognise additional assets or liabilities if needed to reflect new information about facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date.\nThe measurement period shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n\n\n2.4.2 Contingent consideration\nAppendix A of AASB 3 defines contingent consideration as “an obligation of the acquirer to transfer additional assets or equity interests to the former owners of an acquiree as part of the exchange for control of the acquiree if specified future events occur or conditions are met.”\nFor example, if part of the purchase consideration is in the form of shares in the acquirer, then additional shares may be required to be delivered if the acquirer’s share price falls after the acquisition date.\nIn other cases, additional consideration may be due if the acquired entity achieves certain levels of profitability. The kind of contingent consideration is called an earnout.\nAccounting for contingent consideration is outlined in paragraph 58 of AASB 3.\nMany changes in the fair value of contingent consideration will be considered as measurement period adjustments. However, changes resulting from events after the acquisition date, such as meeting earnings targets or reaching a milestone on a research and development project, are not measurement period adjustments.\nThe accounting for such changes depends on the form of the contingent consideration. Contingent consideration classified as equity shall not be remeasured and subsequent settlement shall be accounted for within equity. Non-equity contingent consideration shall be measured at fair value at each reporting date with changes being recognised in profit or loss.\n\n\n2.4.3 Acquisition-related costs\nAcquisition-related costs are costs incurred by an acquirer to effect a business combination. Costs such as finder’s fees, advisory and other professional fees, and the costs an internal acquisitions department—shall be accounted for as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred and services are received. However the costs of registering and issuing debt and equity securities as part of the acquisition shall be recognised in accordance with AASB 132 (IAS 32) and AASB 9 (IFRS 9).\n\n\n2.4.4 Gains on bargain purchase\nIf FVINA exceeds the purchase consideration, then the acquirer will recognise a gain on bargain purchase in profit or loss on the acquisition date.\nParagraph 36 of AASB 3 (IFRS 3) requires that “before recognising a gain on a bargain purchase, the acquirer shall reassess whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and shall recognise any additional assets or liabilities that are identified in that review.”\nThe acquirer shall then review the procedures used to measure the amounts that AASB 3 (IFRS 3) requires to be measured for each element of FVINA and purchase consideration. According to paragraph 36 of AASB 3 (IFRS 3), “the objective of the review is to ensure that the measurements appropriately reflect consideration of all available information as of the acquisition date.” Implicit in the requirement for these reviews is the expectation that gains on bargain purchase will be very rare, but the paragraph 35 of AASB 3 (IFRS 3) does not that such gains might arise in “a forced sale in which the seller is acting under compulsion.”",

BCVR entries\nWe first do the fair value adjustments at the acquisition date. We need to increase inventories by $6,000. However, increasing inventories in the consolidated books does not change the tax base. As we learnt in studying IAS 12, Income Taxes, a positive difference between the carrying amount of an asset and its tax base gives rise to a taxable temporary difference, which in turn results in a deferred tax liability. With a tax rate of 30%, we will recognize a deferred tax liability equal to \\(0.3 \\times 6000 = \\$1,800\\).\nThe net (after-tax) increase in fair value for various assets are accumulated in a special bookkeeping account called the business combination valuation reserve or BCVR for short. In this case, we have a net (after-tax) increase of \\(6000 - 1800 = \\$4,200\\).\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nInventories\n6 000\n\n\n\n Deferred tax liability\n\n1 800\n\n\n BCVR\n\n4 200\n\n\n\nWe need to increase plant by $20,000 (\\(210,000 - 190,000\\)). However, because the plant is “new” to the entity, we also need to “reset” accumulated depreciation of $70,000 (\\(260,000 - 190,000\\)), making an offsetting adjustment to original cost.\nAgain, increasing plant in the consolidated books does not change the tax base. With a tax rate of 30%, we will recognize a deferred tax liability equal to \\(0.3 \\times 20000 = \\$6,000\\). The net (after-tax) increase in fair value for various assets are accumulated in a special bookkeeping account called the business combination valuation reserve or BCVR for short. In this case, we BCVR of \\(20000 - 6000 = \\$14,000\\).\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nAccumulated depreciation\n70 000\n\n\n\n Plant\n\n70 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlant.\n20 000\n\n\n\n Deferred tax liability\n\n6 000\n\n\n BCVR\n\n14 000\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we could combine the effects on Plant to create the following entry.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nAccumulated depreciation\n70 000\n\n\n\n Plant\n\n50 000\n\n\n Deferred tax liability\n\n6 000\n\n\n BCVR\n\n14 000\n\n\n\n(2) Elimination of parent’s investment\nTo complete the elimination of the parent’s investment, we need to conduct an acquisition analysis. The involves calculating the fair value of the consideration transferred and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the subsidiary at acquisition date. We can write FVINA as an abbreviation for “fair value of identifiable net assets”.\nA shortcut approach to calculating FVINA starts with the carrying amount of equity and adds the after-tax fair value adjustments to the assets. We already calculated and accumulated these adjustments in BCVR in the entry above. Thus we have FVINA equal to $428,200, as calculated below.\n\n\n\nShare capital\n250 000\n\n\nGeneral reserve\n10 000\n\n\nRetained earnings\n160 000\n\n\nBCVR (inventories)\n14 000\n\n\nBCVR (plant)\n4 200\n\n\nFVINA\n438 200\n\n\n\nThe amount paid of $480,000 actually related to two distinct assets. First, all the shares in Subsidiary Ltd. Second, the dividend payable of $25,000. Thus only $455,000 (\\(480000 - 25000\\)) represents the consideration applicable to the acquisition of Subsidiary Ltd.\nWith purchase consideration of $455,000 in excess of FVINA, we will record goodwill equal to the difference $16,800 (\\(455000 - 438200\\)). Combining this information into a single entry yields the following elimination entry.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nShare capital\n250 000\n\n\n\nGeneral reserve\n10 000\n\n\n\nRetained earnings\n160 000\n\n\n\nBCVR\n18 200\n\n\n\nGoodwill\n16 800\n\n\n\n Shares in Subsidiary Ltd\n\n455 000\n\n\n\n(3) Eliminate intra-group dividends receivable and payable\nAt the time of acquisition, there is a dividend payable on the books of Subsidiary and a dividend receivable on the books of Parent. However, from the perspective of the group there is neither a liability nor an asset, so we need to eliminate these items. The following entry achieves this. We will study more on intra-group balances and transactions later in the course.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nDividend payable\n25 000\n\n\n\n Dividend receivable\n\n25 000\n\n\n\nEntries one year after acquisition\n1. BCVR entries\nThe totals amounts brought together in BCVR are unchanged. However, the entries brought for these amounts will change as the location of the valuation adjustments evolves.\nTake inventories. The net credit to BCVR of $4,200 has not changed. But the inventories are no longer on hand. Rather they have been sold and the incremental valuation amounts will have been reflected as additional cost of sales at the time of sale. The additional cost of sales would have led to a reduction of income tax expense, and we also need to give effect to this in the consolidation entry. Our consolidation entry for the first year should give effect to these adjustments.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nCost of sales\n6 000\n\n\n\n Income tax expense\n\n1 800\n\n\n BCVR\n\n4 200\n\n\n\nFor plant, the BCVR entry we made at the time of acquisition continues to be relevant.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nAccumulated depreciation\n70 000\n\n\n\n Plant\n\n50 000\n\n\n Deferred tax liability\n\n6 000\n\n\n BCVR\n\n14 000\n\n\n\nHowever, we need to make an adjustment to depreciation expense to reflect depreciation of the fair value increment. Given that the remaining useful life of the equipment is 5 years, we need to depreciate the pre-tax fair value increment of $20,000 over that time, which implies $4,000 incremental annual depreciation. We also need to account for the tax effects of the additional depreciation expense, which imply a reduction in income tax expense of $1,200 (\\(30\\% \\times 4000\\)). The offsetting credit goes to the Deferred tax liability balance created when we established the BCVR entry for plant (see above).\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation expense\n4 000\n\n\n\n Accumulated depreciation\n\n4 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred tax liability\n1 200\n\n\n\n Income tax expense\n\n1 200\n\n\n\n(2) Elimination of parent’s investment\nThis entry is unchanged from above.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nShare capital\n250 000\n\n\n\nGeneral reserve\n10 000\n\n\n\nRetained earnings\n160 000\n\n\n\nBCVR\n18 200\n\n\n\nGoodwill\n16 800\n\n\n\n Shares in Subsidiary Ltd\n\n455 000\n\n\n\n(3) Eliminate intra-group dividends receivable and payable\nNote that, as the intra-group dividend amounts no longer appear on the balance sheets of the entities in the group, there is no longer a need for the elimination entry we made above.\nEntries two years after acquisition\n1.

However, the entries brought for these amounts will have changed again as the location of the valuation adjustments continues to evolve.\nTake inventories. The net credit to BCVR of $4,200 has not changed. But the inventories are no longer on hand and no longer affect current period income. Rather they have been sold and the incremental valuation amounts will now be reflected in the beginning balance of retained earnings. The same is true of the concomitant reduction of income tax expense.\nOur consolidation entry for the second year is thus as follows.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nRetained earnings—beginning\n4 200\n\n\n\n BCVR\n\n4 200\n\n\n\nFor plant, the BCVR entry we made at the time of acquisition continues to be relevant.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nAccumulated depreciation\n70 000\n\n\n\n Plant\n\n50 000\n\n\n Deferred tax liability\n\n6 000\n\n\n BCVR\n\n14 000\n\n\n\nHowever, we again need to make an adjustment to depreciation expense to reflect depreciation of the fair value increment (and its tax effects).

The first column contains the account headings. These are as presented in the accounts of Parent and Subsidiary with the exception of BCVR, which is an account created for the consolidation process. The second and third columns represent the financial information for Parent and Subsidiary, respectively.\nThe next three columns are headed “consolidation adjustments” and are used to post the debits and credits and (in between these) the references for each consolidation entry. The entries above have already been posted in Figure 3.2.\nThe final column of the consolidation worksheet is headed “Group” and represents the consolidated amounts for the group. These amounts are calculated as the sum of the amounts for Parent and Subsidiary plus the effects of the consolidation adjustments. As always, debit items decrease and credit items increase amounts related to total liabilities and shareholders’ equity (including the income statement amounts, which flow via retained earnings). Similarly, debit items increase and credit items decrease amounts related to total assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Consolidation worksheet for year ending 30 June 2018",

However, offsets to BCVR—typically debits—can affect Step 2 and Step 3 elements of NCI.\nWith NCI, the elimination entry is applied in two parts. First, we eliminate the parent’s interest in pre-acquisition equity. Second, we eliminate the NCI in pre-acquisition equity; this is Step 1.\nThe remaining group consolidation entries are largely unaffected. However, each consolidation entry we make needs be examined for effects on beginning-of-period NCI (Step 2) and current period changes in NCI (Step 3).\nIn the presentation in this chapter, the consolidation worksheet is expanded to include a section for NCI. The NCI portion of the worksheet functions much like group portion introduced in previous chapters.",
