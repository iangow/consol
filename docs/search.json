    "text": "1 Preface\nThe purpose of these notes is to provide students of ACCT 90012 Corporate Reporting with a replacement for problematic materials in the course text book, Financial Reporting (fourth edition).\nThe following portions of Financial Reporting can be read profitably in conjunction with these materials:1\nHowever, the following portions of Financial Reporting use approaches inconsistent with these materials and should be avoided or only read by students alert to the inconsistencies.\nThe reason for replacing these materials is that they provide a confusing approach to the business combination valuation reserve (BCVR). The approach to BCVR in Financial Reporting has two problems.\nFirst, treatment of BCVR is not consistent across chapters. For example, BCVR includes goodwill in Chapter 28, but excludes goodwill in Chapter 30 when the partial goodwill method is applied. In the latter case, goodwill is included in the pre-acquisition entry. In contrast, these materials always include goodwill in the pre-acquisition entry.\nSecond, the amount of BCVR varies from one period to the next. Financial Reporting moves (some) revaluation adjustments to the pre-acquisition entry as the associated assets are consumed, even though the total amount of revaluation is unaffected.2 As a result, the pre-acquisition entry in Financial Reporting needs to change in each period as revaluations are shifted to that entry. In contrast, in these materials the amount of revaluation reflected in BCVR does not change (putting aside measurement period adjustments) after the acquisition date. Similarly, the pre-acquisition elimination entry also remains the same in each period.\nInterested students seeking a more comprehensive set of materials used here should note that some textbooks provide a presentation of consolidation accounting fairly consistent with that used in these materials. For example, Accounting for Corporate Combinations and Associations (eighth edition) by Neal Arthur, Louise Luff, Peter Keet, Matthew Egan, Bryan Howieson, and Ronita Ram treats BCVR much as we do in these materials.3",

Generally the closing date—the date on which the acquirer legally transfers the consideration, acquires the assets and assumes the liabilities of the acquiree—is the acquisition date. However, the acquirer might obtain control on another date that is either earlier or later than the closing date. For example, if a written agreement provides that the acquirer obtains control of the acquiree on a date before the closing date.\nOne reason that identification of the acquisition date is important is that it is the measurement date for items such as - the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired - the fair value of purchase consideration - the non-controlling interesting in the acquiree",

However, the application of the recognition principle may result in recognising some assets and liabilities that the acquiree had not previously recognised as assets and liabilities in its financial statements. For example, the acquirer recognises the acquired identifiable intangible assets, such as a brand name, a patent or a customer relationship, which the acquiree did not recognise as assets because it developed them internally and charged the related costs to expense.\nParagraph 18 of AASB 3 (IFRS 3) says: “The acquirer shall measure the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values.” The principles of fair value measurement are spelt out in AASB 13 (IFRS 13) Fair Value Measurement.\nMany acquisitions will lead to the recognition of assets and liabilities that were not recognized in the books of the acquiree. For example, internally generated intangible assets such as brands are not recognized under AASB 138 (IAS 38), but are recognized at acquisition date fair value under AASB 3 (IFRS 3).\nSimilarly under AASB 3 (IFRS 3), an acquirer shall recognise a contingent liability—as defined in AASB 137 (IAS 3) Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets—assumed in a business combination at the acquisition date even if it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.",

    "text": "2.4 Step 4: Measuring and recognizing goodwill (or a gain from bargain purchase)\nParagraph 32 says:\nThe acquirer shall recognise goodwill as of the acquisition date measured as the excess of (A) over (B) below:\nA. the aggregate of:\n\nthe consideration transferred generally measured at acquisition-date fair value\nthe amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree measured in accordance with this IFRS 3, and\nin a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree.\n\nB. the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed (FVINA)\nIf (B) exceeds (A), then the difference gives rise to a gain on bargain purchase that is recognized in profit or loss on the acquisition date and attributed to the acquirer. Paragraph 36 of AASB 3 (IFRS 3) requires that, “before recognising a gain on a bargain purchase, the acquirer shall reassess whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and shall recognise any additional assets or liabilities that are identified in that review.” The implication is that gains on bargain purchase should be very rare.\nIn many acquisitions, goodwill is the largest asset acquired.\n\n2.4.1 Measurement period\nThe measurement period is the period after the acquisition date during which the acquirer may adjust provisional amounts recognised for a business combination.\nDuring the measurement period, provisional amounts recognised shall be retrospectively adjusted to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected their measurement as of the acquisition date. The acquirer shall also recognise additional assets or liabilities if needed to reflect new information about facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date.\nThe measurement period shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n\n\n2.4.2 Contingent consideration\nAppendix A of AASB 3 defines contingent consideration as “an obligation of the acquirer to transfer additional assets or equity interests to the former owners of an acquiree as part of the exchange for control of the acquiree if specified future events occur or conditions are met.”\nFor example, if part of the purchase consideration is in the form of shares in the acquirer, then additional shares may be required to be delivered if the acquirer’s share price falls after the acquisition date.\nIn other cases, additional consideration may be due if the acquired entity achieves certain levels of profitability. The kind of contingent consideration is called an earnout.\nAccounting for contingent consideration is outlined in paragraph 58 of AASB 3.\nMany changes in the fair value of contingent consideration will be considered as measurement period adjustments. However, changes resulting from events after the acquisition date, such as meeting earnings targets or reaching a milestone on a research and development project, are not measurement period adjustments.\nThe accounting for such changes depends on the form of the contingent consideration. Contingent consideration classified as equity shall not be remeasured and subsequent settlement shall be accounted for within equity. Non-equity contingent consideration shall be measured at fair value at each reporting date with changes being recognised in profit or loss.\n\n\n2.4.3 Acquisition-related costs\nAcquisition-related costs are costs incurred by an acquirer to effect a business combination. Costs such as finder’s fees, advisory and other professional fees, and the costs an internal acquisitions department—shall be accounted for as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred and services are received. However the costs of registering and issuing debt and equity securities as part of the acquisition shall be recognised in accordance with AASB 132 (IAS 32) and AASB 9 (IFRS 9).\n\n\n2.4.4 Gains on bargain purchase\nIf FVINA exceeds the purchase consideration, then the acquirer will recognise a gain on bargain purchase in profit or loss on the acquisition date.\nParagraph 36 of AASB 3 (IFRS 3) requires that “before recognising a gain on a bargain purchase, the acquirer shall reassess whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and shall recognise any additional assets or liabilities that are identified in that review.”\nThe acquirer shall then review the procedures used to measure the amounts that AASB 3 (IFRS 3) requires to be measured for each element of FVINA and purchase consideration. According to paragraph 36 of AASB 3 (IFRS 3), “the objective of the review is to ensure that the measurements appropriately reflect consideration of all available information as of the acquisition date.” Implicit in the requirement for these reviews is the expectation that gains on bargain purchase will be very rare, but the paragraph 35 of AASB 3 (IFRS 3) does not that such gains might arise in “a forced sale in which the seller is acting under compulsion.”",

BCVR entries\nWe first do the fair value adjustments at the acquisition date. We need to increase inventories by $6,000. However, increasing inventories in the consolidated books does not change the tax base. As we learnt in studying IAS 12, Income Taxes, a positive difference between the carrying amount of an asset and its tax base gives rise to a taxable temporary difference, which in turn results in a deferred tax liability. With a tax rate of 30%, we will recognize a deferred tax liability equal to \\(0.3 \\times 6000 = \\$1,800\\).\nThe net (after-tax) increase in fair value for various assets are accumulated in a special bookkeeping account called the business combination valuation reserve or BCVR for short. In this case, we have a net (after-tax) increase of \\(6000 - 1800 = \\$4,200\\).\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nInventories\n6 000\n\n\n\n Deferred tax liability\n\n1 800\n\n\n BCVR\n\n4 200\n\n\n\nWe need to increase plant by $20,000 (\\(210000 - 190000\\)). However, because the plant is “new” to the entity, we also need to “reset” accumulated depreciation of $70,000 (\\(260000 - 190000\\)), making an offsetting adjustment to original cost.\nAgain, increasing plant in the consolidated books does not change the tax base. With a tax rate of 30%, we will recognize a deferred tax liability equal to \\(0.3 \\times 20000 = \\$6,000\\). The net (after-tax) increase in fair value for various assets are accumulated in a special bookkeeping account called the business combination valuation reserve or BCVR for short. In this case, we BCVR of \\(20000 - 6000 = \\$14,000\\).\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nAccumulated depreciation\n70 000\n\n\n\n Plant\n\n70 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlant.\n20 000\n\n\n\n Deferred tax liability\n\n6 000\n\n\n BCVR\n\n14 000\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we could combine the effects on Plant to create the following entry.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nAccumulated depreciation\n70 000\n\n\n\n Plant\n\n50 000\n\n\n Deferred tax liability\n\n6 000\n\n\n BCVR\n\n14 000\n\n\n\n(2) Elimination of parent’s investment\nTo complete the elimination of the parent’s investment, we need to conduct an acquisition analysis. The involves calculating the fair value of the consideration transferred and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the subsidiary at acquisition date. We can write FVINA as an abbreviation for “fair value of identifiable net assets”.\nA shortcut approach to calculating FVINA starts with the carrying amount of equity and adds the after-tax fair value adjustments to the assets. We already calculated and accumulated these adjustments in BCVR in the entry above. Thus we have FVINA equal to $438,200, as calculated below.\n\n\n\nShare capital\n250 000\n\n\nGeneral reserve\n10 000\n\n\nRetained earnings\n160 000\n\n\nBCVR (inventories)\n14 000\n\n\nBCVR (plant)\n4 200\n\n\nFVINA\n438 200\n\n\n\nThe amount paid of $480,000 actually related to two distinct assets. First, all the shares in Subsidiary Ltd. Second, the dividend payable of $25,000. Thus only $455,000 (\\(480000 - 25000\\)) represents the consideration applicable to the acquisition of Subsidiary Ltd.\nWith purchase consideration of $455,000 in excess of FVINA, we will record goodwill equal to the difference $16,800 (\\(455000 - 438200\\)). Combining this information into a single entry yields the following elimination entry.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nShare capital\n250 000\n\n\n\nGeneral reserve\n10 000\n\n\n\nRetained earnings\n160 000\n\n\n\nBCVR\n18 200\n\n\n\nGoodwill\n16 800\n\n\n\n Shares in Subsidiary Ltd\n\n455 000\n\n\n\n(3) Eliminate intra-group dividends receivable and payable\nAt the time of acquisition, there is a dividend payable on the books of Subsidiary and a dividend receivable on the books of Parent. However, from the perspective of the group there is neither a liability nor an asset, so we need to eliminate these items. The following entry achieves this.

Our consolidation entry for the first year should give effect to these adjustments.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nCost of sales\n6 000\n\n\n\n Income tax expense\n\n1 800\n\n\n BCVR\n\n4 200\n\n\n\nFor plant, the BCVR entry we made at the time of acquisition continues to be relevant.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nAccumulated depreciation\n70 000\n\n\n\n Plant\n\n50 000\n\n\n Deferred tax liability\n\n6 000\n\n\n BCVR\n\n14 000\n\n\n\nHowever, we need to make an adjustment to depreciation expense to reflect depreciation of the fair value increment. Given that the remaining useful life of the equipment is 5 years, we need to depreciate the pre-tax fair value increment of $20,000 over that time, which implies $4,000 incremental annual depreciation. We also need to account for the tax effects of the additional depreciation expense, which imply a reduction in income tax expense of $1,200 (\\(30\\% \\times 4000\\)). The offsetting credit goes to the Deferred tax liability balance created when we established the BCVR entry for plant (see above).\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation expense\n4 000\n\n\n\n Accumulated depreciation\n\n4 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred tax liability\n1 200\n\n\n\n Income tax expense\n\n1 200\n\n\n\n(2) Elimination of parent’s investment\nThis entry is unchanged from above.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nShare capital\n250 000\n\n\n\nGeneral reserve\n10 000\n\n\n\nRetained earnings\n160 000\n\n\n\nBCVR\n18 200\n\n\n\nGoodwill\n16 800\n\n\n\n Shares in Subsidiary Ltd\n\n455 000\n\n\n\n(3) Eliminate intra-group dividends receivable and payable\nNote that, as the intra-group dividend amounts no longer appear on the balance sheets of the entities in the group, there is no longer a need for the elimination entry we made above.\nEntries two years after acquisition\n1.

The net credit to BCVR of $4,200 has not changed. But the inventories are no longer on hand and no longer affect current period income. Rather they have been sold and the incremental valuation amounts will now be reflected in the beginning balance of retained earnings. The same is true of the concomitant reduction of income tax expense.\nOur consolidation entry for the second year is thus as follows.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nRetained earnings—beginning\n4 200\n\n\n\n BCVR\n\n4 200\n\n\n\nFor plant, the BCVR entry we made at the time of acquisition continues to be relevant.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nAccumulated depreciation\n70 000\n\n\n\n Plant\n\n50 000\n\n\n Deferred tax liability\n\n6 000\n\n\n BCVR\n\n14 000\n\n\n\nHowever, we again need to make an adjustment to depreciation expense to reflect depreciation of the fair value increment (and its tax effects).

The first column contains the account headings. These are as presented in the accounts of Parent and Subsidiary with the exception of BCVR, which is an account created for the consolidation process. The second and third columns represent the financial information for Parent and Subsidiary, respectively.\nThe next three columns are headed “consolidation adjustments” and are used to post the debits and credits and (in between these) the references for each consolidation entry. The entries above have already been posted in Figure 3.2.\nThe final column of the consolidation worksheet is headed “Group” and represents the consolidated amounts for the group. These amounts are calculated as the sum of the amounts for Parent and Subsidiary plus the effects of the consolidation adjustments. As always, debit items decrease and credit items increase amounts related to total liabilities and shareholders’ equity (including the income statement amounts, which flow via retained earnings). Similarly, debit items increase and credit items decrease amounts related to total assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Consolidation worksheet for year ending 30 June 2018",

    "text": "4.2 Example: Petal-Sleet\nOn 1 July 2015, Petal Ltd acquired 100% of the shares of Sleet Ltd for $600,000. At that date, Sleet Ltd’s equity comprised the following:\n\n\n\nShare capital\n400 000\n\n\nGeneral reserve\n110 000\n\n\nRetained earnings\n60 000\n\n\n\nAt 1 July 2015, all the identifiable assets and liabilities of Sleet Ltd were recorded at fair value except for Plant, which had a carrying value of $150,000 (original cost $180,000) and a fair value of $170,000.\nThe plant had a further 5-year life and is expected to be used evenly over that time.\nAdditional information\n\nOn 1 January 2017, Sleet Ltd sold inventories costing $30,000 to Petal Ltd for $40,000. 80% of these inventories were sold to external parties for $52,000 by 30 June 2017.\nAt 1 July 2016, there was $12,000 profit in the inventories of Petal Ltd from goods acquired from Sleet Ltd for $32,000.\nOn 1 January 2016, Sleet Ltd sold inventory item costing $13,000 to Petal Ltd for $17,000. Petal Ltd classified this inventory as equipment and depreciated it on a straight-line basis at 5% per year.\nDividends of $7,000 were paid by Sleet Ltd in the year ended 30 June 2017.\nThere is an intragroup loan of $15,000.\nThe tax rate is 30%.\n\n\n4.2.1 Requirements\n\nPrepare consolidated financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2017.\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Answer: Consolidation journal entries\nEntries at time of acquisition\n1. BCVR entries\nWe first do the fair value adjustments at the acquisition date. We need to increase plant by $20,000 (\\(17000 - 150000\\)). However, because the plant is “new” to the entity, we also need to “reset” accumulated depreciation of $30,000 (\\(180000 - 150000\\)), making an offsetting adjustment to original cost.\nAgain, increasing plant in the consolidated books does not change the tax base. With a tax rate of 30%, we will recognize a deferred tax liability equal to \\(0.3 \\times 20000 = \\$6,000\\). The net (after-tax) increase in fair value for various assets are accumulated in a special bookkeeping account called the business combination valuation reserve or BCVR for short. In this case, we BCVR of \\(20000 - 6000 = \\$14,000\\).\nAs discussed in Chapter 3, we can use the following entry to account for fair value adjustments to plant.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nAccumulated depreciation\n30 000\n\n\n\n Plant\n\n10 000\n\n\n Deferred tax liability\n\n6 000\n\n\n BCVR\n\n14 000\n\n\n\n(2) Elimination of parent’s investment\nTo complete the elimination of the parent’s investment, we need to conduct an acquisition analysis. The involves calculating the fair value of the consideration transferred and the FVINA of the subsidiary at acquisition date.\nA shortcut approach to calculating FVINA starts with the carrying amount of equity and adds the after-tax fair value adjustments to the assets. We already calculated and accumulated these adjustments in BCVR in the entry above. Thus we have FVINA equal to $584,000, as calculated below.\n\n\n\nShare capital\n400 000\n\n\nGeneral reserve\n110 000\n\n\nRetained earnings\n60 000\n\n\nBCVR (plant)\n14 000\n\n\nFVINA\n584 000\n\n\n\nWith purchase consideration of $600,000 in excess of FVINA, we will record goodwill equal to the difference $16,000 (\\(600000 - 584000\\)). Combining this information into a single entry yields the following elimination entry.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nShare capital\n400 000\n\n\n\nGeneral reserve\n110 000\n\n\n\nRetained earnings\n60 000\n\n\n\nBCVR\n14 000\n\n\n\nGoodwill\n16 000\n\n\n\n Shares in Subsidiary Ltd\n\n600 000\n\n\n\nHaving address the acquisition-date entries, we can move forward two years to address the intragroup transactions outlined in the Additional information. Before doing so, we recapitulate the entries for BCVR and elimination of Petal’s investment. Here we can start with the same entry that we made above.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nAccumulated depreciation\n30 000\n\n\n\n Plant\n\n10 000\n\n\n Deferred tax liability\n\n6 000\n\n\n BCVR\n\n14 000\n\n\n\nHowever, we need to account for two years of depreciation of the fair value increment. One year will be in Retained earnings–beginning and one year will be the current period’s depreciation expense.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nRetained earnings–beginning\n4 000\n\n\n\nDepreciation expense\n4 000\n\n\n\n Accumulated depreciation - plant\n\n8 000\n\n\n\nAs always, we need to account for the tax effects of items that have a net effect on revenue and expenses.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nDeferred tax liability\n2 400\n\n\n\n Retained earnings–beginning\n\n1 200\n\n\n Income tax expense\n\n1 200\n\n\n\nThe entry for elimination of Petal’s investment would be unchanged from that above.\nWith those entries out of the way, we move onto the “additional information” entries. We take each item of additional information in turn.\n\n\n4.2.3 Intragroup sales of inventory: Current period\n1. On 1 January 2017, Sleet Ltd sold inventories costing $30,000 to Petal Ltd for $40,000. 80% of these inventories were sold to external parties for $52,000 by 30 June 2017.\nLet’s first focus on the 20% that were unsold. In the books of Sleet, these would have been accounted for at the time of sale as:\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nCash\n8 000\n\n\n\n Revenue\n\n8 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of sales\n6 000\n\n\n\n Inventory\n\n6 000\n\n\n\nIn the books of Petal, the accounting at time of sale would be\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nInventory\n6 000\n\n\n\n Cash\n\n6 000\n\n\n\nBut there is no transaction here from a consolidated perspective, so we need to reverse the effect of these entries:\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n8 000\n\n\n\n Cost of sales\n\n6 000\n\n\n Inventory\n\n2 000\n\n\n\nWhen preparing consolidation journal entries, one always needs to be alert to potential tax effects. Tax effects will arise when the entries have an impact on accounting income. The above entry results in a decrease in accounting income of $2,000 (\\(8000 - 6000\\)).\nBecause the consolidation entry above results in a decrease in accounting income, it also implies a decrease in income tax expense of $600 (\\(2000 \\times 30\\%\\)). As we have seen before, this does not affect income tax payable, so we will create a deferred tax asset of $600 to reflect the decreased income tax expense.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred tax asset\n600\n\n\n\n Income tax expense\n\n600\n\n\n\nNow let’s address the 80% that were sold outside the group. In the books of Sleet, these would have been accounted for at the time of intragroup sale as:\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nCash\n32 000\n\n\n\n Revenue\n\n32 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of sales\n24 000\n\n\n\n Inventory\n\n24 000\n\n\n\nIn the books of Petal, the accounting at time of the intragroup sale would be:\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nInventory\n32 000\n\n\n\n Cash\n\n32 000\n\n\n\nAt the time of the external sale, one entry would be:\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nCost of sales\n32 000\n\n\n\n Inventory\n\n32 000\n\n\n\nIf we combine all of the entries above related to the 80% that were sold outside the group, we see that we have cost of sales twice and revenue recognised on an intragroup sales. Regarding cost of sales, only the $24,000 reflects true costs to the group. To correctly record the effects of the above from a group perspective, we need to reverse the intragroup revenue and reverse the Cost of sales at $32,000. This results in the following consolidation entry:\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n32 000\n\n\n\n Cost of sales\n\n32 000\n\n\n\nBecause there is no net effect on revenues and expenses, there is no need to account for taxes.\nIf we combine the entries for both the unsold and sold portions of inventory we would have the following entry:\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nRevenue\n40 000\n\n\n\n Cost of sales\n\n38 000\n\n\n Inventory\n\n2 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred tax asset\n600\n\n\n\n Income tax expense\n\n600\n\n\n\nA shortcut to this combined entry is to note that all sales need to be reversed (hence we debit $40,000) and that the ending inventory is 20% of the total, for which there was $10,000 in profit, so we need to eliminate $2,000 of profit from ending inventory. The cost of sales amount is then a plug. Finally the tax effect relates to the credit to inventory.\n\n\n4.2.4 Intragroup sales of inventory: Prior period\n1. On 1 January 2017, Sleet Ltd sold inventories costing $30,000 to Petal Ltd for $40,000. 80% of these inventories were sold to external parties for $52,000 by 30 June 2017.\nThe entries above apply to the year ending 30 June 2017. For the year ending 30 June 2018, as far as the above is concerned, we would need to adjust Retained earnings–beginning to reflect the overstatement of income for the year ending 30 June 2017 in the books of Sleet of $2,000 (\\(8000 - 6000\\)). This overstatement is reflected in the books of Petal as an overstatement of inventory.\nFor the year ending 30 June 2018, we would also need to adjust Retained earnings–beginning to reflect this adjustment for taxes. Repeating the entry we discussed above and adding the tax entry would give us the following consolidation journal entries for the year ending 30 June 2018 for the unsold portion of intragroup sales for the year ending 30 June 2017.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nRetained earnings–beginning\n2 000\n\n\n\n Inventory\n\n2 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred tax asset\n600\n\n\n\n Retained earnings–beginning\n\n600\n\n\n\nAt the end of the period, the inventory would have been sold externally and this would require the following consolidation journal entries:\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nInventory\n2 000\n\n\n\n Cost of sales\n\n2 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax expense\n600\n\n\n\n Deferred tax asset\n\n600\n\n\n\nIn reality, we would likely just prepare a consolidated balance sheet at the end of that period, so we can prepare a simpler entry combining the two entries above:\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nRetained earnings–beginning\n1 400\n\n\n\nIncome tax expense\n600\n\n\n\n Cost of sales\n\n2 000\n\n\n\nThese entries may be a little puzzling at first. So it is important to think about the following as you work through these kinds of exercises:\n\nWhat is the impact of the consolidation entries on tax expense in each period?\nWhat is the impact of these entries on total tax expense over the two periods?\n\nYou may wonder how we can debit deferred tax assets in one period, but not credit it in the next period. The answer is that these are consolidation journal entries, which means that the deferred tax asset created on consolidation for the year ending 30 June 2017 does not persist in the way that a similar entry would if made in the books of Petal or Sleet. Because the deferred tax asset is “consumed” in the year ending 30 June 2018, there is no need to re-create it in preparing consolidation journal entries for that period.\n2. At 1 July 2016, there was $12,000 profit in the inventories of Petal Ltd from goods acquired from Sleet Ltd for $32,000.\nThis is similar to the item above as applied to the unsold portion of inventories. There we saw a need to eliminate the unrealised profit and a similar entry would have been made for the year ended 30 June 2016. This consolidation journal entry would have reduced the ending amount of retained earnings. Because such consolidation journal entries to retained earnings are made in a consolidation worksheet, they do not automatically carry over from one period to the next and we need to address them in the consolidation worksheet.\nIn this case, we need to reduce both Inventory and Retained earnings–beginning by the $12,000.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nRetained earnings–beginning\n12 000\n\n\n\n Inventory\n\n12 000\n\n\n\nWe also need to adjust the entry made by Petal when the goods were sold. Because the inventory value in the books of Petal is (from the group perspective) overstated by $12,000, cost of sales will also be overstated. The following entry reverses this effect.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nInventory\n12 000\n\n\n\n Cost of sales\n\n12 000\n\n\n\nOf course, we could combine the two entries above into a single entry:\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nRetained earnings–beginning\n12 000\n\n\n\n Cost of sales\n\n12 000\n\n\n\nAs always, when we are making consolidation entries that have a net effect on revenues and expenses, we need to be thinking about AASB 112 Income Taxes. Based on the analysis above, when we reduced the value of inventory, we would have recognized reduced income tax expense and a corresponding deferred tax asset of $3,600 \\((12000 \\times 30\\%)\\). In principle, we should make an adjustment for this prior-period item:\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nDeferred tax asset\n3 600\n\n\n\n Retained earnings–beginning\n\n3 600\n\n\n\nTo reflect the elimination related to the sale of inventory, we would recognize the consumption of the deferred tax asset.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax expense\n3 600\n\n\n\n Deferred tax asset\n\n3 600\n\n\n\nAgain, we could combine the two entries above into a single entry:\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax expense\n3 600\n\n\n\n Retained earnings–beginning\n\n3 600\n\n\n\nIn practice, we could go directly the combined entry above to the entry here by multiplying the pre-tax amounts by 30%.

On 1 January 2016, Sleet Ltd sold inventory item costing $13,000 to Petal Ltd for $17,000. Petal Ltd classified this inventory as equipment and depreciated it on a straight-line basis at 5% per year.\nIn Sleet’s books we would have\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nCash\n17 000\n\n\n\n Sales revenue\n\n17 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of sales\n13 000\n\n\n\n Inventory\n\n13 000\n\n\n\nIn Petal’s books we would have (at the time of purchase):\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nEquipment\n17 000\n\n\n\n Cash\n\n17 000\n\n\n\nIn the first year, Petal would record six months of depreciation (or 2.5%):\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation expense\n425\n\n\n\n Accumulated depreciation\n\n425\n\n\n\nIn the second year, Petal would record a full year’s depreciation (or 5%):\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation expense\n850\n\n\n\n Accumulated depreciation\n\n850\n\n\n\nThe reclassification of the item from inventory to PP&E is real and should not be reversed. While inventory will be expensed as cost of sales, PP&E will be expensed as depreciation.\nWe first need to reverse the effects on asset values of the initial transaction. In the year of sale, this would mean eliminating the $4,000 of pre-tax profit (and associated tax effects). In subsequent periods, this mean eliminating the $4,000 (before tax) and associated tax effects from beginning retained earnings.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nRetained earnings–beginning\n4 000\n\n\n\n Equipment\n\n4 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred tax asset\n1 200\n\n\n\n Retained earnings–beginning\n\n1 200\n\n\n\nHowever the depreciation in the books of Petal Ltd will be based on the “inflated” value it paid for it, not the original cost to the group. So we need to reverse the portion of depreciation related to the increase in value from the internal sale. For the first year, this “excess” depreciation would be $100 (\\(4000 \\times 2.5\\%\\)). For the second year, this “excess” depreciation would be $200 (\\(4000 \\times 5\\%\\)).\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nAccumulated depreciation\n300\n\n\n\n Retained earnings–beginning\n\n100\n\n\n Depreciation expense\n\n200\n\n\n\nBecause these entries affect income, we need to account for their tax effects. Intuitively, the two debits are just 30% of the two credits in the entry above. The credit can be thought of as the amount of the deferred tax asset that has been used up by the debits.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nRetained earnings–beginning\n30\n\n\n\nIncome tax expense\n60\n\n\n\n Deferred tax asset\n\n90\n\n\n\n4. Dividends of $7,000 were paid by Sleet Ltd in the year ended 30 June 2017.\nAs Figure 4.2 makes clear, nothing has happened from a group perspective. No cash has been moved out of the larger (blue) box and, while the equity claim of Petal in Sleet has decreased in value, this equity claim does not appear in the consolidated accounts as it does not represent an interest of parties outside the larger (blue) box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Dividends paid\n\n\n\nNote that there are no intragroup assets or liabilities related to the dividends at the end of the period, so there is nothing to eliminate on the balance sheet.\nThe only entries we need are those related to reversal of the payment of the dividend. Paragraph 12 of AASB 127 (IAS 27) Separate Financial Statements says:\n\nAn entity shall recognise a dividend from a subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate in profit or loss in its separate financial statements when its right to receive the dividend is established.\n\nAs such, the entry in the books of Petal would be:\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nCash\n7 000\n\n\n\n Dividend revenue\n\n7 000\n\n\n\nAs such, the entry in the books of Petal would be:\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nDividends paid\n7 000\n\n\n\n Cash\n\n7 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nDividend revenue\n7 000\n\n\n\n Dividends paid\n\n7 000\n\n\n\nThe Dividends paid account for Sleet would likely be closed against its retained earnings. At the end of the period the Dividend revenue account for Petal would be closed against its retained earnings. Because there is no net effect on the consolidated balance sheet, there is no need to make adjustments in subsequent periods.\nNote also that we assume that intragroup dividends have no tax consequences (for example, in Australia they might be fully franked) and for this reason there is no need to concern ourselves with tax effects of dividends.\n5. There is an intra-group loan of $15,000.\nHere we assume that Petal lent money to Sleet and that this loan was made under a formal contract. This loan gives rise to a financial asset for Petal and a financial liability for Sleet. Sleet has “a contractual right to receive cash … from another entity” (Petal), which meets the definition of a financial asset in paragraph 11 of AASB 132 (IAS 32) Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation. Petal has a “contractual obligation to deliver cash … to another entity” (Sleet), which meets the definition of a financial liability in paragraph 11 of AASB 132 (IAS 32).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Intragroup loan\n\n\n\nHowever, as is clear in Figure 4.3, there is neither a financial asset nor a financial liability from a group perspective. There is no “other entity” outside the group to which amounts are owed to or by. Here we simply need to eliminate the asset and liability using the following entry.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nLoan payable\n15 000\n\n\n\n Loan receivable\n\n15 000",

While intragroup sales of services will give rise to profits to the seller, there is generally no store of these on the balance sheet of the buyer and hence no profits to be eliminated. All we need to do is eliminate the revenue and expenses much like we did for inventory that has been sold externally. Because there is no net effect on retained earnings of the group, there is no need to make adjustments in subsequent periods.\nNote that if the payments by the buyer somehow end up on the balance sheet of the buyer (e.g., the expenditures are capitalised), there may be a need to eliminate unrealised profit from the balance sheet.\n\n\n4.3.2 Interest on intragroup borrowing\nThis is very much like intragroup services. So long as the interest costs of the borrower are expensed and not capitalised and the interest inflows to the lender are recognised as revenue, then there is no need to eliminate profits from the balance sheet.",

As we will see below, we can think of this as a single entry eliminating the investments of both the parent and NCI in the subsidiary or as two entries, one for the parent and one for NCI. While either approach gets the same result as the other, for thinking about NCI, it can be helpful to use the second approach.1\nThe information for both Step 2 and Step 3 comes from two sources:\nRecall that the consolidation worksheet involves adding the amounts of the books of the parent to those in the books of the subsidiary, then including the effects of the consolidation journal entries. Because NCI relates to subsidiaries, not the parent, in a two-entity consolidation, the separate books of the subsidiary are relevant, not the separate books of the parent.\nIn the example below, we will actually implement the three steps above as part of the consolidation process to yield the following processes.\nIn preparing the analysis, it may be easier to do Steps 1, 2(a), and 3(a) before Steps 2(b) and 3(b), as this means that we process all entries related to consolidation journal entries separate from those drawing on the subsidiary’s separate accounts.",

Prepare the consolidation worksheet entries for year ended 30 June 2014\n\nAll the inventory on hand at 1 July 2013 was sold by 30 June 2014.\nAcquired plant had a remaining useful life of 10 years, with benefits to be received evenly over this period.\nSubsidiary Ltd made a profit of $40,000 for the year ended 30 June 2014. No other changes occurred in equity.\n\n\nBCVR entry\n\nAfter one year, the fair value increments associated with inventory and plant will have been wholly (inventory) or partly (plant) realised as expenses. While the principles are the same for these two items, we will do what we did in Chapter 3 and take slightly different approaches to these two items.\nFor plant, we reiterate the BCVR entry made at acquisition, but we now supplement it with an entry to recognise depreciation for the year. With a fair value increment of $50,000 and remaining useful life of 10 years, we have annual depreciation (of the fair value increment) of $5,000.\nOf course, an additional expense of $5,000 implies a reduction of income tax expense of $1,500. This is applied to the deferred tax liability created in the acquisition-date BCVR entry.\nAs the inventory was all sold in the first year, we need to debit Cost of sales rather than Inventory. This additional expense upon consolidation of $10,000 implies a reduction of income tax expense of $3,000. As always, the credit to BCVR for inventory remains at its original $7,000.\nBecause nothing has happened to land since acquisition, the associated BCVR entry is unchanged.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nAcc. dep. – Plant\n30 000\n\n\n\nPlant\n20 000\n\n\n\n Deferred tax liability\n\n15 000\n\n\n BCVR\n\n35 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation expense\n5 000\n\n\n\n Acc. dep. – Plant\n\n5 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred tax liability\n1 500\n\n\n\n Income tax expense\n\n1 500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of sales\n10 000\n\n\n\n Income tax expense\n\n3 000\n\n\n BCVR\n\n7 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand\n60 000\n\n\n\n Deferred tax liability\n\n18 000\n\n\n BCVR\n\n42 000\n\n\n\n\nElimination of investment in subsidiary\n\nThis entry is unchanged from that made at acquisition (see above).

Because the acquisition was made at the start of the current period, there is not “Step 2” here (i.e., there are not changes in NCI between acquisition date and the start of the current period).\nWe start by analysing the consolidation entries above for possible effects on NCI.\n(1’) BCVR entry–NCI\nBecause the acquisition-date entry for BCVR applies to the group, there is no separate entry for NCI for that portion (Step 1).\nHowever, the BCVR entry we made above also relates to Step 3 because there are effects on current-period income. The effects on group income are all connected with the subsidiary in which NCI relates. These effects are:\n\n–5,000 (depreciation expense) +1,500 (income tax expense)\n–10,000 (cost of sales) +3,000 (income tax expense)\n\nThus the total effect is –10,500, of which 2,100 (\\(20\\% \\times -10500\\)) relates to NCI.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nNCI\n2 100\n\n\n\n NCI share of profit\n\n2 100\n\n\n\n(2’) “Elimination” of NCI at acquisition3\nWe saw the following entry above.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nShare capital\n26 000\n\n\n\nGeneral reserve\n14 000\n\n\n\nRetained earnings - beginning\n10 000\n\n\n\nBCVR\n16 800\n\n\n\nNCI\n\n66 800\n\n\n\n(3’) Recognition of NCI share of change in equity\nThe entries above relate to consolidation entries. However, we also need to account for the NCI share of changes in the reported equity in the current period. We are told above that the only change in the equity of the subsidiary is a profit of $40,000. Of this, $8,000 (\\(20\\% \\times 40000\\)) is attributable to NCI.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nNCI share of profit\n8 000\n\n\n\n NCI\n\n8 000\n\n\n\n4. Prepare the consolidation worksheet entries for year ended 30 June 2017\n\nAt 1 July 2016, there was $15,000 profit in the inventories of Parent Ltd Ltd from goods acquired from Subsidiary Ltd for $45,000.\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2017, Subsidiary Ltd sold inventory costing $15,000 to Parent Ltd for $30,000. On 30 June 2017, $6,000 of inventory was still on hand in Parent’s books.\nOn 1 April 2017, Subsidiary Ltd sold an item of plant with a carrying amount of $40,000 (cost $160,000, accumulated depreciation $120,000) to Parent Ltd for $60,000. The item was still on hand at the end of the year. Parent Ltd applied a 20% depreciation rate to this type of plant.\n\n\nBCVR entry\n\nWe can use our BCVR entry for the previous answer as a template..\nAgain, we reiterate the BCVR entry made at acquisition for plant, but we now supplement it with an entry to recognise depreciation since acquisition. With annual depreciation of the fair value increment of $5,000, we have three years prior to this year plus this year’s depreciation ($15,000). These imply a reduction of income tax expense of $1,500 in the current period and $4,500 in previous periods (now in Retained earnings–beginning) The tax amounts are applied to the deferred tax liability created in the acquisition-date BCVR entry.\nAs the inventory was all sold in the first year, the debit is entirely to Retained earnings–beginning.\nBecause nothing has happened to land since acquisition, the associated BCVR entry is unchanged.\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nAcc. dep. – Plant\n30 000\n\n\n\nPlant\n20 000\n\n\n\n Deferred tax liability\n\n15 000\n\n\n BCVR\n\n35 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetained earnings–beginning\n15 000\n\n\n\nDepreciation expense\n5 000\n\n\n\n Acc. dep. – Plant\n\n20 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred tax liability\n6 000\n\n\n\n Income tax expense\n\n1 500\n\n\n Retained earnings–beginning\n\n4 500\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetained earnings–beginning\n7 000\n\n\n\n BCVR\n\n7 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand\n60 000\n\n\n\n Deferred tax liability\n\n18 000\n\n\n BCVR\n\n42 000\n\n\n\n\nElimination of investment in subsidiary\n\nThis entry is unchanged from that made at acquisition (see above).\n\nReversal of sales – realised\n\nAs discussed in Chapter 4, for the elimination of intragroup sales of inventory in the current period, we can prepare separate consolidation journal entries for the realised and unrealised portions.

The original cost for this inventory was $3,000 (\\(15000 \\div 30000 \\times 6000\\)). Thus we have $3,000 in unrealised profit in inventory, which requires the entry below. Eliminating this profit means reducing income tax expense by $900 (\\(30\\% \\times 3000\\)). This reduction gives rise to a deferred tax asset (intuitively, we need to debit something to balance the credit to Income tax expense).\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nSales\n6 000\n\n\n\n Cost of sales\n\n3 000\n\n\n Inventory\n\n3 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred tax asset\n900\n\n\n\n Income tax expense\n\n900\n\n\n\n\nElimination of profit in beginning inventory\n\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nRetained earnings–beginning\n15 000\n\n\n\n Cost of sales\n\n15 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax expense\n4 500\n\n\n\n Retained earnings–beginning\n\n4 500\n\n\n\n\nReverse effects of intragroup sale of PP&E\n\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nProfit on sale of plant\n20 000\n\n\n\n Plant and equipment\n\n20 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred tax assets\n6 000\n\n\n\n Income tax expense\n\n6 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcc. dep. – plant\n1 000\n\n\n\n Income tax expense\n\n1 000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax expense.\n300\n\n\n\n Deferred tax asset\n\n300\n\n\n\n\nReverse intragroup dividend\n\n\n\n\n\nDebit\nCredit\n\n\n\n\nDividend revenue\n24 000\n\n\n\n Dividend paid\n\n24 000\n\n\n\n(1’) BCVR entry – NCI impact\nLooking at (1) above, we see debits to Retained earnings–beginning of 15,000 and 7,000 and a credit of 4,500.
